\title{Layout an igraph object using easylayout's web application.}
\usage{
easylayout(graph)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{An igraph object representing the network to be laid out.}
}
\value{
A two column matrix with XY coordinates and N rows, where N is
the number of vertices in the graph.
}
\description{
The \code{easylayout} function takes an igraph object and serializes`
it into a web application integrated with the IDEâ€™s interface
through a Shiny server. The web application lays out the network by
simulating attraction and repulsion forces. Simulation parameters
can be adjusted in real-time. An editing mode allows moving and rotating
nodes. Once the user finishes tinkering the layout, it is sent back to the
R session to be plotted through popular libraries like ggplot2 or even the
base package itself.
